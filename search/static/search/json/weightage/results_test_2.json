         "summary":"In my QA career, I have been working on various system platforms and operating systems like Windows 95, Windows 2000, Windows XP and MAC. I have tested applications developed in Java, C++, Visual Basic and so on. I have tested Web-based applications as well as client server applications.  As a QA person, I have written Test Plans, Test Cases, attended walkthrough meetings with the Business Analysts, Project Managers, Business Managers and QA Leads. Attended requirement review meetings and provided feedback to the Business Analysts. I have worked in different databases like Oracle and DB2, wrote SQL queries to retrieve data from the database.  As far as different types of testing is concerned, I have performed Smoke Testing, Functional Testing, Back_end_Testing, BlackBox Testing, Integration Testing, Regression Testing and UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Testing. I have participated in Load Testing and Stress Testing.  I have written defects as they are found using JIRA and Unfuddle. Once the defects were fixed, retested them and if the passed, closed them. If the defects were not fixed, then reopened them. I have also attended the defect assessment meetings as necessary.  In the meantime, a continuous interaction with developers was necessary.  This is pretty much what I have been doing as a QA person.",

As part of that team, I not only worked on crucial new features (which involve partnership across multiple teams) but also lead the effort to convert the service into a micro service architecture. The goal of this effort was to help devs be more agile and reduce the feature release time. I initially joined Accounts team at Oracle Cloud. I worked on some challenging customer features as part of the team. I also lead the effort to redesign the entire service to be more robust, fault tolerant and decrease latency. I migrated the framework of the entire Accounts service while it was live. The project was executed in such a fashion that there was 0% downtime. Because of the new design changes; the average latency time of the APIs was decreased 7 times. I also lead the effort to architect the entire service to be purely asynchronous. I also solved problems and challenges related to data replication and communication between different regions. Due to lack of a mechanism for flighting features (enabling\/disabling features at run time), I created a pluggable and easy to use library using which features could be easily enabled\/disabled at run time without any need for re-deployment. This library is not only used by my team but also by the entire Platform org. see less",

         "summary":"Computer Science has always excited me, not just the programming part of it but the power of creation it gives me. The power to create, innovate and give life to an idea from birth till inception. The power to drive a thought and shape it into something substantial. Those were the grounds on which I plunged into the limitless world of Computer Sciences, and opted for a bachelor in it. The journey went pretty smooth owing to my inherent inclination towards Software Engineering. But the journey did not _end_there, that\u2019s where it all started from.  A highly passionate, diligent, skilled professional and an experienced CS graduate. It\u2019s now more than 2 years since I have been working as a Software Engineer in a fairly well reputed Software house i.e., Confiz Limited in Lahore, Pakistan. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer in AG Zurich Dubai, engaging my years of learned skill set into enhancing an enterprise level Banking Solution.   Full Stack Developer: Ruby - Ruby on Rails Php   -  Codeigniter Java  Python - Django",
